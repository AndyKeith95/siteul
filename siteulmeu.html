                <h3>Beyond fear lies Freedom</h3>
                <p>All about living life to the fullest. Trying to stay out as much as i can. From time to time i can be
                    found working out inside but only if the gym admits machines overuse. I can also be found climbing
                    steep terains and rugged faces of mountains just for fun</p>
